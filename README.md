# Unity-Template
A starter unity project with a lot of niceties out of the box.

## Why?
Often when I make a new unity project, I find myself implementing a lot of the same things and structure, so I decided to make a sort of "template" where all of those things have already been done :)

## What is anything? How do I use this at all?
I've lightly documented (mostly) all classes in the project. Read, deal with it, and figure it out :)

## Do you promise to keep the project updated and to respond to any bug reports and/or feature requests expeditiously?
No, I have a full-time job, and I don't have to for that. Deal with it :)

## Get it now! For the low-low price of [a mention in the credits]!
But for real! Feel free to test, experiment, use, and sell on your own accord. Just remember to give due credit to me, please, and thanks :>
