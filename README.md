# What is... Unity-Template?
At first glance, you may think this a bog-standard, normal-ass unity project... and, well, that's because it is. Sorta, it's a little more than that though, at least so I'd like to think. "What makes it special then?" I hear you ask, and I'm glad you did because I'm actually quite excited to tell you :)
###
The relative "uniquness" of this project arrises from the fact that it comes out of the box with some prebuilt "architecture" and "logic" beyond what unity provides to you by default, woah :O

## Features (not exhaustive)
### Very minimal clutter
I've structured all the files related to the template such that they are out of the way for any new project files. The project folder structure looks something like this:
```
Assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _External
|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Template
|       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (where all the files related to the template are stored)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _Project
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (where all your files would go)
```
### Audio
- [AudioManager.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Audio/AudioManager.cs) - If you like using FMOD, this is for you! AudioManager uses exclusively FMOD to play sounds (just do it the regular way otherwise). Provides an easy way to play FMOD events, at a specified location, or attached to an object.

### Core
- [Singleton.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Core/Singleton.cs) - Highly contentious! Personally, I like using singletons, in moderation. Simple enough to explain, provides my personal implementation of singletons in Unity for MonoBehaviour scripts via the SingletonBehaviour class.
  ###
  As an additional feature there is also the SingletonAsset class which allows you to create singleton ScriptableObjects. The way this works is say you have a ScriptableObject and want to make it into a singleton. You make it inherit from SingletonAsset, and by the default behaviour, you will get an error logged in the output if that asset is missing from your Resources folder. You will also get a warning logged if there is more than one of those assets.
  ###
  Once the asset has been created in the Resources folder you can then access that asset from (pretty much) anywhere in your code using the AssetUtility.GetSingletonAsset function (caching included!) There is also a seperate (not recommended, but possible) way you can do this, which is by using the SingletonAssetAttribute to specify you want to AutoCreate the asset in the Resources folder. That way, it will automatically create the asset, if it is missing.
  ###
  As stated, this is not the recommended way as it can sometimes create unintuitive behaviours when messing around with the asset, but for those who want the quality of life feature, it's there. Just be aware of the potential unintuitiveness auto-creation can bring.
  ###
- [SerializableInterface.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Core/Editor/SerializableInterface.cs) - Exposes a field in the inspector to allow you to drag any object into that field which inherits from a specified interface (and inherits from Unity's Object class). You can constrict the type of the objects you can drag to the field by specifying a different covering type. For example, if you choose MonoBehaviour as the covering type, only MonoBehaviours (who also inherit from the interface) can be dragged into the field.
  ###
- [State.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Core/StateMachine/State.cs), and [StateMachine.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Core/StateMachine/StateMachine.cs) - Simple enough. Provides an implementation of a generic finite state machine. Quite proud of how far I was able to push C#'s generic type system to prevent you from setting a state on a state machine that it is not meant for.
  ###
- [TimeManager.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Core/Time/TimeManager.cs) - Simply for modifying Unity's timeScale in a safe and reversable way. If you use TimeManager to change the timeScale it'll send out events every time, as well as specific events for when time has frozen, and unfrozen. As an additional feature, you can also use it to create hitstops. If you don't know what a hitstop is, it's basically when time momentarily slows down during something like an attack impact to add some extra "oomph."

### Gameplay
- [ValuePool.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Gameplay/ValuePool.cs), and [DamagePool.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Gameplay/Damage/DamagePool.cs) - Provides a simple implementation of a damage system heavily inspired by the one implemented in Unreal (albeit I don't have too much experience with it :p) This is achieved by having "DamagePools" as fields on objects which store the current, minimum and maximum damage, as well as methods for changing it and events for when it does change. With damage there also comes damage types, which you can create and specify as you like. There is also the more lightweight version, "ValuePool," which simply omits the concept of damage types, but otherwise keeps all the same functionality as DamagePools.

### Physics
- [PhysicsChecker.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Physics/PhysicsChecker.cs) - Provides useful physics-related information such as if you are currently moving, or grounded to a surface, and the normal of the surface you are currently standing on.
  ###
- [ExtendedPhysics.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Physics/ExtendedPhysics.cs), and [ExtendedPhysicsMaterial.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Physics/ExtendedPhysicsMaterial.cs) - Attach the ExtendedPhysics script to an object and assign an ExtendedPhysicsMaterial (created via context menu) to use this feature. ExtendedPhysicsMaterials store information for all vanilla physics material properties (such as friction and bounciness), as well as support for bounciness values that go above one. They also store values for linear and angular drag which allow you to apply linear and angular drag to any objects that are currently in contact with a collider that's attached to an ExtendedPhysics script.

### Saving
- [SaveManager.cs](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/blob/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/Saving/SaveManager.cs) - A saving system! Very proud of this one :) Provides a simple framework for saving/loading different states of your game to/from a file on disk. It automatically handles things like serialization/deserialization for a short list of basic unity types (currently) (might add more supported types later... or you could do it it yourself... or ask me to do it :p) Multiple save "slots" are supported by default.

### UI
- [Forwardings](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/tree/main/Assets/_External/Template/Scripts/UI/Forwardings) - Provides a simple way of forwarding various functions (for previously mentioned and unmentioned scripts, as well as some vanilla ones) for use with user interface (like... for buttons or something, idfk).

## Examples/Documentation
Looking for examples? You can find a handful [here!](https://github.com/Lobsternator/Unity-Template/tree/main/Assets/_External/Template/Examples) It is by no means an exhaustive list of examples, but you will find some of the most useful ones (in my opinion). I've also lightly documented (mostly) all classes in the project, so feel free to read and learn that way too :)

## Why?
Often when I make new unity projects, I find myself implementing a lot of the same things in the same kind of structure, so I decided to make a sort of "template" where all of those same things have already been implemented (as well as various features I could see myself getting some good use out of). I also figured, why not give others the ability to use it as well :)

## Do you promise to keep the project updated and to respond to any bug reports and/or feature requests expeditiously?
Maybe... I'd be more motivated if you say please :)
###
In all seriousness though, this is currently just a hobby project I do on the side for fun, but if it would happen by some miracle to get some popularity... uhhhm... shit OwO Guess I might have to... that's what I'm signing myself up for then I suppose :p
